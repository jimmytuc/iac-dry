# Example modules for Terragrunt

This repo contains the following example code:

* [asg-elb-service](/asg-elb-service): An example of how to deploy an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with an Elastic Load 
  Balancer (ELB) in front of it. We run a dirt-simple "web server" on top of the ASG that always returns "Hello, World".

* [postgres](/postgres): An example of how to deploy Postgres on top of Amazon's Relational Database Service (RDS).  

Note: This code is solely for demonstration purposes. This is not production-ready code, so use at your own risk. If 
you are interested in battle-tested, production-ready Terraform code, check out [Gruntwork](http://www.gruntwork.io/).
